I recently discovered [[https://git.scicore.unibas.ch/TBRU/Treemmer][Treemmer]] ([[https://doi.org/10.1101/249391][Menardo et al., bioRxiv, 2018]]) for reducing the
complexity of large trees down to a few representative taxa. Turned out to be
really useful for my analyses!

Here are just a few crude lines of bash and R code to animate the process of
Treemming a phylogenetic tree using [[https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/ggtree][ggtree]] & [[https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate][gganimate]].

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd example
../treemmer-animate.sh tree.nwk
Rscript ../treemmer-animate.R
#+END_SRC
